# React Router Dom v6 Unexpected Error with Dynamic Route

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using React Router Dom v6 with dynamic route segments.  The error occurs when a route with a dynamic segment is defined, but that segment is not handled correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior or a crash.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` file shows an example where an unexpected route is added and not correctly handled. This leads to an error when trying to navigate to the route.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by properly handling the dynamic segments or removing any undefined routes.  This ensures the application handles unexpected navigation more gracefully.
